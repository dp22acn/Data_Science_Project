Network Analysis On Mahabharata
Project Title
Project Overview
This project is based on Creating A network from text and Doing Social network Analysis on mahabharata
This project aims to model the Mahabharata as a real-world social network, breaking its characters, events, and relationships into a network structure. By applying social network analysis techniques, this study reveals insights into the complex web of interactions and power dynamics in the Mahabharata.

Technologies Used
Python
NetworkX
Pandas
Matplotlib for visualization
Ghepi Network Analysis Software
Data Source
Mahabharata books from online source  https://sacred-texts.com/hin/maha/index.htm

Example:
The dataset for this project was kindly provided by [Name of Data Provider]. It includes character interactions and events from the Mahabharata, which were used to construct the social network.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and structured the data to identify characters, events, and relationships.
Network Construction: Built a social network by mapping characters and their interactions.
Analysis: Applied various network metrics, such as centrality, clustering coefficient, and average path length, to understand the social structure.
Visualization: Pythonâ€™s visualization libraries were used to create interactive graphs of the social network.


The analysis of the Mahabharata as a social network revealed several key insights:

Central characters like Krishna and Arjuna play pivotal roles in the network, influencing the course of events.
The network has an average path length of 2, and a clustering coefficient of 0.35, highlighting tight-knit groups within the larger narrative.
